ðŸ‘‹ Hello! My name is **Renato Rodrigues dos Santos JÃºnior**, Iâ€™m 21 years old, and Iâ€™m currently pursuing a **Bachelor's degree in Information Systems**. Although I don't have professional experience as a developer yet, I am passionate about technology and programming, and Iâ€™m committed to continuous learning.

Currently, Iâ€™m focusing on developing skills in various areas of programming, with an emphasis on back-end, databases, and algorithms. My GitHub is a space where I share my projects, studies, and progress as I advance through my degree and personal projects.

### What I'm learning:

Iâ€™m always open to new learning opportunities and collaborations!
